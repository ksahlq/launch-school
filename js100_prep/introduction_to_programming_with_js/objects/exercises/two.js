/*
Which of the following values are valid keys for objects?
* 1
* '1' 
* undefined 
* 'hello world' 
* true 
* 'true' 

All the listed values are valid. 
Note, though, that JavaScript coerces the non-string key values to strings. 
Given the listed values, 1 and '1' represent the same key, as do true and 'true'
